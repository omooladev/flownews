//note------>The code in this file uses React Router to manage routing.
//note       The BrowserRouter component is used to wrap the entire application,
//note       and the AppContextProvider and AuthContextProvider components are used
//note       to provide context to the application. The App component is the main
//note       component of the application, and it renders the application's UI.
//note       The AppContextProvider component provides access to the application's state,
//note       and the AuthContextProvider component provides access to the application's
//note       authentication state. The App component uses these contexts to render the
//note       application's UI. The index.css file contains the application's CSS styles.
